The ESP8266-01 is a Wi-Fi module that allows any microcontroller system access to a Wi-Fi network. This module is a self-contained SOC (System On a Chip) that doesn’t necessarily need a microcontroller to manipulate inputs and outputs as you would normally do with an Arduino. ESP8266-01 basically having two GPIO pins. We can simply program the ESP8266 to not only have access to a Wi-Fi network, but to act as a microcontroller as well. This makes the ESP8266 very versatile. In this tutorial I am going to communicate with ESP8266-01 module.

ESP-01 Setup

When you buy the ESP8266 ESP-01, it comes with a pre-installed AT firmware. It is possible to program the chip with another firmware such as LUA firmware, for example. However, AT firmware is compatible with the Arduino IDE.

ESP8266 ESP-01 Pinout
Upload the BareMinimum example to ensure that no previous programs are running and using the serial communication channel.

One more thing in my previous post I have mentioned to bypass arduino in order to establish communication with esp module.

Just make low the RESET pin of arduino

This will make you to communicate with esp at the baudrate of 115200
Else at 9600 it will display garbage value.

If you do not wish to bypass arduino board then remain RESET pin as it is

This will make you to communicate with esp in both baudrate of 115200 and 9600.
Next, open the serial monitor and type the following command:

AT
You should get an “OK” response. Do it several times to receive OK response. Now we are ready to test a two way communication between the module and another device.

Basic AT commands  

The ESP8266 ESP-01 module has three operation modes:

Station (STA)
Access Point (AP)
Both
In AP the Wi-Fi module acts as a Wi-Fi network, or access point (hence the name), allowing other devices to connect to it. It simply establishes a two way communication between the ESP8266 and the device that is connected to ESP via Wi-Fi.

In STA mode, the ESP8266-01 can connect to an AP such as the Wi-Fi network from your smartphone or simply Hotspot.

The third mode of operation permits the module to act as both an AP and a STA.

Here we are going to set the module to operate in STA mode:

AT+CWMODE=1
The corresponding number for each mode of operation is as follows:

STA = 1
AP = 2
Both  = 3
If you want to check what mode your Wi-Fi module is in, you can simply type the following command:

AT+CWMODE?
This will display a number (1, 2, or 3) associated with the corresponding mode of operation.

Now if you want to print the firmware version then just put this command:

AT+GMR
